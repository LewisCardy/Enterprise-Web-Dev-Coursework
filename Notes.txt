NOTES FOR WEBSITE

need to figure out a way to keep the logged in state at page refresh generally 
and due to the fact when a quote is removed the page refreshes.

when logged in it stays when changing pages but after refresh the logged in state goes away.

general cleanup, messy logs and missing a lot off ; at the end;

useability will be improved when the major issue is fixed
