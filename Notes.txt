NOTES FOR WEBSITE

need to figure out a way to keep the logged in state at page refresh generally 
and due to the fact when a quote is removed the page refreshes.

when logged in it stays when changing pages but after refresh the logged in state goes away.

general cleanup, messy logs and missing a lot off ; at the end;

useability will be improved when the major issue is fixed

when refrashing on the wuotes page the quotes dissapear but not thwn navigating just when refreshing.
i need to have a way to remove the edit on the quote because there is an error if i edit it twice

need to have a system to not save quotes if not logged in

admin stuff according to coursework
